# Password Generator

This project features a Password generator that asks the user first a PROMPT of "how long do you want your password" MUST BE BETWEEN 8-128. If the user DOES NOT enter a NUMBER value between 8-128 or a NUMBER, it will PROMPT AGAIN "how long do you want your password" until a NUMBER and the value is between 8-128. Followed by 4 confirms asking if they want the password to have at least one NUMBER, at least one SPECIAL CHARACTER, at least one UPPERCASE LETTER, at least one LOWERCASE LETTER. If the user does not pick one of the confirms (NUMBER, SPECIAL CHARACTER, UPPERCASE LETTER, LOWERCASE LETTER) Confirm repeats until at least one is selected. When user clicks generate password button a Password with the selected criteria (NUMBER, SPECIAL CHARACTER, UPPERCASE LETTER, LOWERCASE LETTER, LENGTH) will appear. The generate password button then becomes disabled. The user can copy the password.
